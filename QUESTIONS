01. Should the LSI be based on the 20-News-Dataset? If not, what
    should we use?

02. 150k unique terms? The U matrix itself is quite large ...
    Perhaps we should exclude terms with small document frequencies
    e.g. df of 1 ...

03. Can we use nltk.stem to stem the terms?
    (stem.("oed") fails, add the length check in porter.py)
